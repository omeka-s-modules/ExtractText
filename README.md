# Extract Text

Extract text from files to make them searchable and machine readable.

This module has the following features:

- When adding a media, the module will automatically extract text from the file and set the text to the media.
- When adding or editing an item, the module will automatically aggregate the media text (in order) and set the text to the item.
- When editing an item or batch editing items, the user can choose to refresh or clear the extracted text.
- When editing a media, the user can choose to refresh or clear the extracted text.
